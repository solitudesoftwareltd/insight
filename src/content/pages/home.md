          ### CAREERS


          Did you know the creative industries span design, media, performance,
          and technology, covering roles from hands-on artists to technical
          specialists. Key sectors include film/TV, gaming, advertising,
          publishing, fashion, and architecture, with popular jobs like graphic
          designers, animators, producers, copywriters, and curators.


          ### BUSINESS


          The Backstage Centre stood out as a premier national training hub
          dedicated to nurturing creative and cultural skills. The impressive
          facility was not only home to Acme Studios for artists but also
          offered extensive resources for those in the entertainment industry.


          ### INDUSTRY


          The creative industries in the UK are experiencing significant
          challenges with recruitment, primarily driven by a sharp rise in
          skills shortages and a "tough" environment for entry-level roles.
          While the sector has seen overall growth in employment, it is facing a
          paradox of high demand for talent alongside a shrinking pool of
          accessible, entry-level jobs.

          Did you know the CIOB advocate for promoting construction as a STEM
          field with varied roles (project management, digital, health & safety)
          beyond just site work, equal to university degrees, and call for built
          environment GCSEs to improve awareness and skills?


          ### BUSINESS


          The CIOB is a leading international professional body for those
          working in and leading the construction industry. They offer a range

          ### INDUSTRY


          The UK construction sector stands at a pivotal crossroads as the
          government outlines ambitious plans to revitalise the economy and
          accelerate infrastructure development. With the economy still
          recovering from years of turbulence, the government is focused on
          fixing the challenges left behind and delivering real change for
          working people - a promise resonating strongly within the construction
          industry.

          needed for the 2025 – 2029 period is estimated at 47,860 per year,
          which is equivalent to 1.8% of the 2024 workforce. This means the UK
          construction industry needs to recruit the equivalent of 239,300 extra
          workers over the next five years.

          Did you know that finding a career in the first year after release
          reduces reoffending? But too often, one of the most loyal, resilient,
          and untapped talent pools is overlooked by employers: prison leavers.
          Changing perceptions of prisons, prison leavers and engaging new and
          underrepresented employers is key to increasing career opportunities
          on release and reducing reoffending.


          ### BUSINESS


          HMPPS is His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service, responsible for
          keeping prisoners in custody while helping them lead law-abiding
          lives. The New Futures Network (NFN) is a specialist part of HMPPS
          that connects employers with prisons to create job opportunities for
          prison leavers, helping to fill labour gaps for employers and reduce
          reoffending.


          ### INDUSTRY


          A third of businesses state that they are unable to address skills
          gaps in their workforce, according to the Chartered Institute of
          Personnel and Development (CIPD). Thinking outside the box about
          recruitment and exploring new talent pools can help overcome such
          challenges. By offering a fair chance, businesses don’t just change
          lives they gain, reduced recruitment costs through a ready-made
          pipeline of trained candidates, improved retention with loyal and
          motivated employees, stronger reputation as an inclusive and socially
          responsible employer, and access to new skills that fill real
          workforce gaps.

          ### INDUSTRY


          New industry data shows persistent recruitment difficulties across
          roofing and cladding, with many employers reporting hard-to-fill
          vacancies for qualified operatives, supervisors and technical
          specialists. These challenges have been amplified by an ageing
          workforce, post-pandemic attrition, limited training capacity,
          regional labour shortages and the increasing complexity of building
          safety and retrofit standards. In response, trade bodies such as NFRC
          are prioritising workforce renewal, competence frameworks, modern
          training approaches and employer engagement—but sustained investment
          is needed to secure the future workforce the sector requires.

          integral to the Royal Navy, capable of deploying globally on their own
          or with the Navy's support.


          ### INDUSTRY


          New data from the Ministry of Defence confirms recruitment pressures
          across the Armed Forces have persisted for several years with far
          fewer recruits being trained, especially since the pandemic. In
          response, ministers pledged a renewed focus on recruitment and
          readiness, which will take time to show results, but the figures
          underline how deeply recruitment challenges have affected the UK’s
          military strength over the past half decade.

          work across housing, commercial buildings, infrastructure and net-zero
          programmes. Increasingly, roofing companies are integrating digital
          tools, improved quality assurance, and upskilled workforces to meet
          rising standards.


          ### INDUSTRY


          New industry data shows persistent recruitment difficulties across
          roofing and cladding, with many employers reporting hard-to-fill
          vacancies for qualified operatives, supervisors and technical
          specialists. These challenges have been amplified by an ageing
          workforce, post-pandemic attrition, limited training capacity,
          regional labour shortages and the increasing complexity of building
          safety and retrofit standards. In response, trade bodies such as NFRC
          are prioritising workforce renewal, competence frameworks, modern
          training approaches and employer engagement - but sustained investment
          is needed to secure the future workforce the sector requires.

          ### CAREERS


          Did you know that finding a career in the first year after release
          reduces reoffending? But too often, one of the most loyal, resilient,
          and untapped talent pools is overlooked by employers: prison leavers.
          Changing perceptions of prisons, prison leavers and engaging new and
          underrepresented employers is key to increasing career opportunities
          on release and reducing reoffending.


          ### BUSINESS


          Taylor Wimpey plc is a leading national housebuilder, developing
          high-quality residential properties and managing the entire
          homebuilding process from initial site acquisition to after-sales
          service. Their doors are open to everyone from all backgrounds, from
          new starters to career changers and returners, on-site and off. They
          don’t just build houses, they build careers, and if you thought house
          building was all about hard hats and high vis – think again!


          ### INDUSTRY


          The house building industry is facing a mix of challenges and
          opportunities, with labour shortages, rising costs, and a push for
          sustainability creating hurdles, while a forecast of economic growth
          and government investment in housing and infrastructure offers
          potential for recovery and expansion.

          Did you know that civil engineering branches into specialisms like
          Structural, Geotechnical, Transportation, Environmental, and Water
          Resources, leading to diverse roles in Construction Management,
          Design, Consulting, and Sustainable Infrastructure, with new paths
          emerging constantly in areas like Smart Cities and Data-Driven Design?


          ### BUSINESS


          University of Exeter is a world-leading UK university, part of the
          prestigious Russell Group, offering research and teaching across three
          campuses in the South West. IIE booked employers and transported
          students into working environments they had never experienced before
          through 16 newly shot 360º films and virtual reality headsets.


          ### INDUSTRY


          The civil engineering industry is experiencing significant recruitment
          struggles as demand for skilled professionals outpaces the supply of
          new graduates and experienced workers. This is driven by increasing
          infrastructure needs, an ageing workforce, and a limited pipeline of
          new engineers, making it challenging for firms to find qualified
          candidates, especially mid-level ones.

          Did you know Waterdance offers career pathways from deckhand to
          skipper that can be exciting, challenging and financially rewarding.
          Valuable in other ways, the technical and practical seafaring skills,
          Sea Survival training, and working as part of a crew help develop
          skills for life, such as team-building, resilience and dedication.


          ### BUSINESS


          Waterdance Ltd is a family-owned fishing company and is part of the
          Greendale Group. They have over 20 boats based in Devon and Cornwall,
          including beam trawlers, netters, potters and crabbers. Working to
          look after our seas, they collect fishing data to ensure stocks remain
          sustainable, support Fishing For Litter (FFL), an environmental
          project, and place the safety of their crews above anything else.


          ### INDUSTRY


          Accessing skilled labour continues to be the dominant employment issue
          for the UK fishing fleet. Amongst the issues contributing to the
          shortage of skilled labour is the sector’s ageing workforce. Other
          reasons include difficulties in finding local crew and attracting new
          entrants. For some vessel operators\*\*,\*\* the recent changes to the
          visa system have made it more difficult and more costly to recruit
          skilled crew from overseas.
